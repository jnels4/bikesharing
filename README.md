# bikesharing overview

An analysis of citi-bike data for the month of august in 2019. 

# Purpose

A client wished to analyze bike sharing data from NYC to determine if a bike-share program would work in Des Moines, Iowa.  The analysis was performed on citibike data from NYC, and will be used to extrapolate the viability of a bike-share program for our client.  Investors were interested in the data, so we presented it using tablaeu (and this readme file).
